Prior to analysis D, the gain correction has been performed on the Po-210 peak. However, there is an issue with  the Po-218 Rate vs Time chi-square/dof being 43.10/13. There is gain variation within the ROIs presumably from subpar gain correction. Analysis D will attempt to address this by basing gain correction off of the Po-214 peak, which has a higher event density than the Po-210 line

this appears to help alleviate some of the gain variance issues within the ROIs..
