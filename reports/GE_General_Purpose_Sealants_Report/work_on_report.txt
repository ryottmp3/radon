Hi Ryott,

Thanks for the preliminary report.

Joseph (cc’d) should be able to provide you with the exact sizes of the samples, and he or James (also cc’d) should be able to provide photos.

I look forward to seeing the additional backup plots.

I was under the impression that the code can be made to apply the likelihood to the combines 218Po + 214Po, rather than merely using the weighted mean.  Are you able to do that (or is that what you did)?

Thanks,
Dr. Schnee
