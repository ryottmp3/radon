\begin{frame}{Overview of Emanation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Two samples were emanated throughout the latter half of 2023
        \begin{itemize}
            \item GE All-Purpose Silicone Sealant was emanated four times\\
                with a total of 465 hours of usable assay data.
            \item GE Advandced Silicone Sealant was emanated three times\\
                with a total of N hours of usable assay data.
        \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Run 717 Analysis}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Emanation Rate was determined to be 0.00 $\pm$ 0.03 mBq.
        \item This determination was based on the observed emanation rate of $^{214}$Po.
        \item The $^{218}$Po rate wasn't used as poor resolution between the peaks of \@
            $^{218}$Po and $^{210}$Po likely caused $^{210}$Po events to spill over \@
            into the $^{218}$Po ROI
